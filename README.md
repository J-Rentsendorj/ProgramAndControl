# **Program and Control**
Pacman inspired React Three Fiber application. The game uses several dependencies including @react-three/drei for 3D rendering in a React.JS environment, @react-three/rapier for physics, howler for sound effects, leva for easy control management, react-use for custom hooks, three.js for 3D graphics, and zustand for state management. The game is built to be played in web browser and provides an immersive 3D gaming experience reminiscent of the original Pac-Man game with an EDM twist. Mobile game control mechanics is currently in development.
